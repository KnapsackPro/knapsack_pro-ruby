# Scenario 1
# Test case when the file has syntax error and it cannot be run via Minitest.
# Test file: test/controllers/pending_controller_test.rb
# To reproduce the case add to the test file at the very beginning:
#
# MissingConstantHereToTestDefect
#
# Unfortunately pending controller test would fail during runtime and the timing for CI node won't be recorded.
# That's fine. Knapsack Pro API would return again the tests that supposed to be run when the developer will retry CI node.

# Scenario 2
# We want to test scenario when the test file won't be executed (it's empty) and
# to the Knapsack Pro API should be send summary of tests timing with the empty test file.
# When KNAPSACK_PRO_FIXED_QUEUE_SPLIT=true we expect retried CI build to run the empty test file.

# If you want to record a new CI build then set
# KNAPSACK_PRO_FIXED_QUEUE_SPLIT=false
# and run this file for both CI nodes.
# bin/edge_cases/knapsack_pro_queue_minitest_missing_constant 0
# bin/edge_cases/knapsack_pro_queue_minitest_missing_constant 1
# Then you can set
# KNAPSACK_PRO_FIXED_QUEUE_SPLIT=true
# and run tests to see if the test file:
# test/controllers/pending_controller_test.rb
# was executed.
